# Automatic_handwritten_notes_cleaner
During college life, students often share their notes through social media platforms. However, after the completion of sem, manually deleting these shared images can be a time-consuming task. To address this issue, I've made a system that can automatically detect and remove exam notes—photos taken with mobile cameras—from the shared content.
